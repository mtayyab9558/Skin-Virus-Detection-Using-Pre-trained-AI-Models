# Skin-Virus-Detection-Using-Pre-trained-AI-Models
This AI project, titled "Classification of Diseases," focuses on developing an automated image classification system for the early diagnosis of infectious diseases like chickenpox, measles, and monkeypox. The project aims to improve diagnostic speed and accuracy using deep learning techniques. The team utilized models like CNN, modified VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, and employed data augmentation and ensemble methods to enhance performance. The project achieved test accuracies of 77.27% and 84.82% and anticipates benefits such as early disease detection, better public health strategies, and optimized resource allocation. The developed methodologies could also be adapted for detecting other infectious diseases.
